# PyTorch-based Deep Learning Scholarship Challenge

Y. David Chen

Sponsored by Udacity and Facebook

## Overview

This challenge lasts from November 2018 to January 2019. My application to cover the cost of deep learning-related Udacity curriculum/training and compete in the scholarship challenge was accepted.

This repository consists of two sub-directories:

* `lessons_and_tutorials`: Notes, scratch, and programming effort for the Udacity online curriculum
* `final_project`: Scripts and notes for the challenge project

For academic/research integrity reasons, this repository is not publicly available until January 9, 2019, the closing date of the challenge. All raw and intermediate data are NOT uploaded to the repository.

## Evaluation

To execute the DL framework, run the following:

```{python}
python3 ImageClassifierProject.py

Epoch: 1 	Training Loss: 4.0730 	Validation Loss: 2.7753
Epoch: 2 	Training Loss: 2.4659 	Validation Loss: 1.5436
Epoch: 3 	Training Loss: 1.8164 	Validation Loss: 1.2530
Epoch: 4 	Training Loss: 1.5160 	Validation Loss: 0.9614
Epoch: 5 	Training Loss: 1.3062 	Validation Loss: 0.8765
Epoch: 6 	Training Loss: 1.1801 	Validation Loss: 0.7944
Epoch: 7 	Training Loss: 1.0486 	Validation Loss: 0.8016
Epoch: 8 	Training Loss: 0.9690 	Validation Loss: 0.6938
Epoch: 9 	Training Loss: 0.9206 	Validation Loss: 0.6198
Epoch: 10 	Training Loss: 0.8659 	Validation Loss: 0.6705
```

A `classifier.pt` file will be generated. This file is then uploaded to Udacity's server for evaluation.
